# Passdown — Daily Watchman + Triage (weekdays 6:13 AM HST)
Last updated: 2026-10-14 (Skyline cap fix build session).

## Watching
- **Skyline "No Skyline trip" on the first rush-hour try, Kapolei → downtown** (OPEN since Oct 7; alerts.md). Phase 2 went live Oct 13 ~2:30 PM (trip search now one server request). Keep running the SILENT FAILURES check and the 60 s retry; log "seen again" lines, don't re-investigate.
- Health planner time ~5.8–6.2 s (flag line 6000 ms). Slowness is known (planner speed parked).

## Next run
- Skyline alert is CLOSED (Oct 14). Keep the SILENT FAILURES check + 60 s retry; if "No Skyline trip" returns, reopen in alerts.md and escalate to MAIN (inbox.md). Planner health 5.4–6.4 s: only flag if >6000 AND new info; known issue.

## Recent runs (newest first: R+ found/fixed, R0 nothing, S skipped)
- R0 (Wed Oct 14: Skyline first-try OK on default + phone path → alert closed; only health planner 6403 ms, known)
